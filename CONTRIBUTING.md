# Contributing to AI Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our AI project! By following these guidelines, youâ€™ll help us maintain a collaborative, welcoming, and productive environment.

## How to Contribute

### Fork the Repository
1. Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page to copy the repository to your GitHub account.
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FakhirK90/ai-projects.git

### Make Your Changes
Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
Use clear and concise comments where necessary.
Follow the coding conventions of the project. For example:
Python: Follow PEP8 guidelines.
AI models: Include proper documentation of the model and parameters.
Ensure that your code solves the issue or enhances the project as expected.

### Add or Modify Tests
If your change includes new functionality, add relevant unit/integration tests.
Run tests before submitting your contribution to ensure nothing is broken.

### Run AI Scripts
For data science or AI-specific contributions, ensure that your scripts are:

Well-Documented: Provide comments and docstrings explaining the purpose and usage of each function.
Reproducible: Include any setup scripts, requirements files, and steps necessary to replicate your results.
Environment Setup: Ensure that a clear environment setup guide is provided (e.g., using conda, venv, or requirements.txt). Example of running AI scripts:


## Guidelines for Submitting Valid Contributions
To maintain high code quality, follow these guidelines:

Code Quality: Ensure that your code is clean, modular, and efficient.
Use consistent naming conventions.
Avoid redundant code and follow DRY principles.
Documentation: Provide clear comments and documentation for functions, classes, and scripts.
Testing: Include unit or integration tests to ensure the robustness of your contribution. Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.
Reproducibility: For AI and data science projects, always provide the necessary files (e.g., requirements.txt, .env, Dockerfile) and instructions to set up and run the code.


## Specific Instructions for Data Science/AI Contributions
For AI/data science projects, ensure that:

### Data: 
Include instructions to obtain and preprocess any datasets required to run your code. Avoid including large datasets in the repository itself.
### Models: Provide details about the models used, including:
Hyperparameters
Evaluation metrics
Model architecture
### Scripts:
Ensure the scripts are reproducible by providing environment setup instructions (e.g., using requirements.txt, conda, or Docker).
Provide scripts for training, evaluation, and visualization (e.g., visualizing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

## Submitting Feedback or Issues
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, feel free to open an issue. Please provide:

A clear description of the problem.
Steps to reproduce (if reporting a bug).
Any additional context or suggestions for enhancement.
